# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains a log of significant architectural decisions. Each ADR is a short document that describes the context, the decision, and the consequences of a choice.

ADRs help us understand the "why" behind our technical choices, especially for new team members or when revisiting a decision in the future.

## Current ADRs

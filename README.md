# StudyHub - Documentation Repository

Welcome to the central documentation hub for the StudyHub project. This repository contains all planning documents, architectural decisions, API/event contracts, and developer guides.

The code for the project resides in a separate repository.

## Purpose

This repository serves as the "single source of truth" for:
- **Project Vision & Architecture:** What we are building and why.
- **Development Roadmap:** Detailed plans for each sprint/phase.
- **Service Contracts:** How our microservices communicate with each other.
- **Operational Guides:** How to run, test, and deploy the application.

## Navigation

- **[Architecture](./architecture/README.md):** High-level system design and tech stack.
- **[Sprints](./sprints/README.md):** Detailed breakdown of the development plan.
- **[Contracts](./contracts/README.md):** API and event specifications.
- **[Guides](./guides/README.md):** Practical how-to documents for developers.
